                <h2>Foz do Iguaçu (Paraná)</h2>
                <p>
                    Did you know you can combine adrenaline and enjoy one of the most beautiful views in Brazil?
                    This is possible in Foz do Iguaçu. The city is home to one of the most beautiful national parks in the country and is world famous for the Iguazu Falls.
                    The current makes the region ideal for rafting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The tour consists of a 4 km route — 2 km in calm waters and another 2 km in rapids that even form waves. 
                    Best of all, you can get very close to the waterfalls, which makes the adventure even more unforgettable.

                <h2>Bonito (Mato Grosso do Sul)</h2>
                <p>

                    The rivers that bathe the region are suitable for rafting due to the currents, such as the Formoso River, which extends for up to 7 km where the traveler passes through 3 rapids and admires the beautiful landscape along the way.
